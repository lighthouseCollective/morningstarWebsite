### Structure of the Site
This single-page website is designed to quickly educate viewers about Morninstar Balloon Co, and encourage them to purchase / inquire about a flight. To serve this dual purpose of lead generation and customer education, we have created a one-page vertical scroll through webpage with information about the Captain, the balloon, the team and the overwhile mission, concluding in a contactFrom that is intended to generate leads from customer interest.

At any time, the viewer can return to the top of the page by clicking the logo in the top left of the screen, on the navBar. The user can also click the "Contact us" button on the right side of the navBar to be quickly pushed to the contactForm. Because the navBar follows the user down the page, it is very easy and quick to navigate to the varying sections of the site.
